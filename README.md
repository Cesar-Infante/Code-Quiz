# Code-Quiz
For this rigorous challenge, we had to build out an application that has many moving parts to it, from a responsive design to functions behind the scenes. Going about this challenge was a hard one it involved a good understanding of JavaScript along with some DOM manipulation. Getting help is something I learned for this challenge and that reaching out isn't bad to get a better understanding. Even though this project is not complete it gives me a baseline of where I have to improve and an opportunity to keep learning! I will be back to test my might on this challenge!
